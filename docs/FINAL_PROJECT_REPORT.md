## Data Pipeline Flow

### End-to-End Data Journey

```
1. URL Submission (Frontend)
   └─> POST /api/v1/scrape/submit
       └─> Kafka Producer (raw-data topic)

2. Scraping (Worker)
   └─> Kafka Consumer reads job
       └─> Selenium scrapes Basketball Reference
           └─> MongoDB saves raw HTML (raw_data collection)
               └─> Kafka Producer (processed topic)

3. Processing (Worker)
   └─> Kafka Consumer reads raw data
       └─> Parse HTML to structured JSON
           └─> MongoDB saves processed stats (processed_stats collection)
               └─> Generate text embeddings (OpenAI)
                   └─> ChromaDB saves vectors

4. Query (Frontend → API → RAG)
   └─> User asks question
       └─> Embed query text
           └─> ChromaDB similarity search
               └─> Retrieve top 3 relevant stats
                   └─> GPT-4 generates answer
                       └─> Return response with sources
```

### Data Transformations

**Raw HTML → Structured Stats:**
```python
# Input: HTML table row
<tr><td>2023-24</td><td>LAL</td><td>71</td><td>1,476</td>...</tr>

# Output: JSON document
{
  "season": "2023-24",
  "team": "LAL",
  "games": 71,
  "points": 1476,
  "ppg": 20.8
}
```

**Stats → Vector Embeddings:**
```python
# Input: Player stats text
"LeBron James: 40,474 career points, 11,185 rebounds, 11,009 assists"

# Output: 1536-dimensional vector
[0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ..., 0.234]
```

### Production Considerations (Future)

**Recommended Stack:**
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx or Traefik
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (managed)
- **Message Queue**: Confluent Cloud (managed Kafka)
- **CDN**: Cloudflare for frontend assets

**Scaling Strategy:**
- Horizontal scaling: Multiple API replicas
- Worker scaling: Kafka consumer group expansion
- Database sharding: MongoDB horizontal partitioning
- Caching layer: Redis for frequent queries

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Inconsistent Data Formats
**Problem**: Basketball Reference uses different table structures across player pages (rookies vs veterans, active vs retired).

**Solution**: 
- Implemented flexible table detection logic
- Multiple parsing strategies with fallbacks
- Validation layer to catch malformed data
- Default values for missing fields

**Code Example:**
```python
def parse_stats_table(table):
    try:
        # Try primary parsing method
        return parse_standard_format(table)
    except ParseError:
        # Fallback to alternative format
        return parse_alternative_format(table)
```

### Challenge 2: Rate Limiting & IP Blocking
**Problem**: Basketball Reference implements rate limiting that blocked frequent requests.

**Solution**:
- Added random delays between requests (2-5 seconds)
- Implemented exponential backoff for retries
- Rotated user-agent strings
- Respected robots.txt directives

### Challenge 3: Kafka Consumer Lag
**Problem**: Processor worker couldn't keep up with scraper output during bulk jobs.

**Solution**:
- Increased consumer parallelism (single → multiple threads)
- Optimized database write operations (bulk inserts)
- Added consumer group for load distribution
- Implemented batch processing for embeddings

### Challenge 4: ChromaDB Performance
**Problem**: Vector search became slow with increasing document count.

**Solution**:
- Enabled persistent storage for indexing
- Optimized embedding dimensions (kept at 1536)
- Implemented query result caching
- Added index warmup on startup

### Challenge 5: Frontend-Backend Integration
**Problem**: API response structures didn't match frontend expectations, causing display issues.

**Solution**:
- Standardized API response formats
- Created comprehensive API documentation
- Added TypeScript-like JSDoc comments
- Implemented response validation middleware

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// Frontend expected: response.data.players
// API returned: response.data.results
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Updated frontend to match API
const players = response.data.results || [];
```

### Challenge 6: Real-time UI Updates
**Problem**: Dashboard metrics were stale and didn't reflect live system state.

**Solution**:
- Implemented polling with setInterval (5-10 second intervals)
- Added optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Used React hooks for efficient re-renders
- Implemented error boundaries for resilience

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights

1. **Microservices Complexity**: While microservices provide scalability, they introduce operational complexity. Proper monitoring and logging are essential from day one.

2. **Message Queue Value**: Kafka proved invaluable for decoupling services and handling asynchronous workloads, but requires careful consumer group management.

3. **Vector Search Performance**: ChromaDB exceeded expectations for semantic search quality but required tuning for optimal performance at scale.

4. **React State Management**: For this project size, built-in React hooks (useState, useEffect) were sufficient, but larger projects would benefit from Redux or Context API.

5. **API Design Consistency**: Standardizing response formats early prevents frontend-backend integration issues later.

### Development Process

1. **Incremental Development**: Building in phases with clear milestones helped maintain focus and allowed for iterative testing.

2. **Documentation Importance**: Writing documentation alongside code (not after) saved significant time and prevented knowledge gaps.

3. **Testing Early**: Unit tests written during development caught bugs before integration, reducing debugging time.

4. **Docker Benefits**: Containerization simplified dependency management and made the system portable across environments.

### Best Practices Applied

1. **Environment Variables**: All secrets and configs in `.env` file, never committed to Git
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
3. **Logging**: Structured logging throughout the system for debugging
4. **Code Organization**: Modular structure with clear separation of concerns
5. **Version Control**: Frequent commits with descriptive messages
